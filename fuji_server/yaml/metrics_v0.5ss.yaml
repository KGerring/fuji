  ## ---------------- FINDABILITY ---------------- ##
- metric_identifier: FsF-F2-01M-ss
  metric_number: 3
  metric_short_name: Descriptive Core Metadata
  metric_name: Metadata includes descriptive core elements (title, identifier, publisher, abstract and language) relevant for the social sciences to support data findability.
  description: Metadata is descriptive information about a data object. Since the metadata required differs depending on the users and their applications, this metric focuses on core metadata. The social science community has defined specific requirements for core metadata and the individual content to be described with it defined in the CESSDA Metadata Model (CMM). These are community specific with respect to certain properties but coincide to a large extent with domain agnostic specifications such as  common data citation guidelines (e.g., DataCite, ESIP, and IASSIST), and metadata recommendations for data discovery (e.g., EOSC Datasets Minimum Information (EDMI), DataCite Metadata Schema, W3C Recommendation Data on the Web Best Practices and Data Catalog Vocabulary). Core descriptive metadata for social sciences data are title, identifier, publisher, abstract and language.
  fair_principle: F2
  target: Metadata
  evaluation_mechanism: Use the data identifier to access its metadata document. Parse or retrieve core metadata, e.g., through one or more options below, combine the results and then verify presence/absence of the core elements in the metadata. Structured data embedded in the landing page of the identifier (e.g., Schema.org, Dublin Core meta tags or RDFa metadata) Typed Links in the HTTP Link header leading to DDI or compatible metadata; for more information, see https://signposting.org/conventions/ Content negotiation (including external negotiation services offered by PID providers) to retrieve DDI metadata or a compatible standard.

- metric_identifier: FsF-F4-01M-ss
  metric_number: 5
  metric_short_name: Searchable Metadata
  metric_name: Metadata is offered in such a way that it can be retrieved programmatically.
  description: This metric refers to ways through which the metadata of data is exposed or provided in a standard and machine-readable format. Assessing this metric will require an understanding of the capabilities offered by the data repository used to host the data. Metadata may be available through multiple endpoints. For example, if data is hosted by a repository, the repository may disseminate its metadata through a metadata harvesting protocol (e.g., via OAI-PMH) and/or a web service. Metadata may also be embedded as structured data on a data page for use by web search engines such as Google and Bing or be available as linked (open) data.
  fair_principle: F4
  target: Metadata
  evaluation_mechanism: The metric is evaluated using the given metadata standards known to support major search engines such as JSON-LD and Dublin Core. Presence of metadata in research data registries is further evaluated.

  metric_number: 11
  metric_short_name: Metadata with Semantic Resources
  metric_name: Metadata uses semantic resources
  description: A metadata document or selected parts of the document may incorporate additional terms from semantic resources (also referred as semantic artefacts) so that the contents are unambiguous and can be processed automatically by machines. This enrichment facilitates enhanced data search and interoperability of data from different sources. Ontology, thesaurus, and taxonomy are kinds of semantic resources, and they come with varying degrees of expressiveness and computational complexity. Knowledge organization schemes such as thesaurus and taxonomy are semantically less formal than ontologies.

  metric_short_name: Data Usage License
  metric_name: Metadata includes license information under which data can be reused.
  description: This metric evaluates if data is associated with a license because otherwise users cannot reuse it in a clear legal context. We encourage the application of licenses for all kinds of data whether public, restricted or for specific users. Without an explicit license, users do not have a clear idea of what can be done with your data. Licenses can be of standard type (Creative Commons, Open Data Commons Open Database License) or bespoke licenses, and rights statements which indicate the conditions under which data can be reused. It is highly recommended to use a standard, machine-readable license such that it can be interpreted by machines and humans. In order to inform users about what rights they have to use a dataset, the license information should be specified as part of the datasetâ€™s metadata.
  fair_principle: R1.1
  target: Metadata
  evaluation_mechanism: Metric evaluation is based on the presence of a machine readable license information in an appropriate metadata element/field.

- metric_identifier: FsF-R1.3-01M-ss
  metric_number: 16
  metric_short_name: Community-Endorsed Metadata Standard
  metric_name: Metadata follows a standard recommended by the target research community of the data.
  description: In addition to core metadata required to support data discovery (covered under metric FsF-F2-01M), metadata to support data reusability should be made available following community-endorsed metadata standards. Some communities have well-established metadata standards (e.g., geospatial [ISO19115], biodiversity [DarwinCore, ABCD, EML], social science [DDI], astronomy [International Virtual Observatory Alliance Technical Specifications]) while others have limited standards or standards that are under development (e.g., engineering and linguistics). The use of community-endorsed metadata standards is usually encouraged and supported by domain and discipline-specific repositories.
